# Tiny Twitter Link Expander

This is a Firefox extension that replaces the Twitter short URL used in timeline links with the actual URL being shared. This makes it more difficult for Twitter to track what links you click (and makes your Twitter links load faster).

The functionality is nearly identical to the [Twitter Link Expander](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/twitter-link-expander/?src=search) extension. The main difference is that this uses only a few lines of JavaScript instead of the jQuery and jQuery.whenLive plugins. This was a little experiment in optimizing source code for very specific use cases. In the other extension the jQuery and jQuery.whenlive plugins were included in their entirety when only a few small paths of those code are actually used. This extension attempts to just include those specific code paths.

## To build

For installation, build the XPI and add it to Firefox through "Open File".

```
npm install
./node_modules/.bin/jpm xpi
```

For development, you can use JPM tools to post updated versions to a Firefox browser that is listening:

```
./watch.sh
```

If you don't want to install/use NodeJS, you can also use `make_firefox.sh` script which will built the extension
